## Introduction

The Sequence Read Archive (SRA) is a public repository that contains high-throughput sequencing data. It is a part of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC), which includes several major institutes: the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) in the USA, the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) in Europe, and the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) in Japan. The SRA includes data from all life forms, as well as metagenomics and ecological studies. The SRA stores raw sequencing data and sometimes the processed alignment data. Researchers often use the SRA to deposit their data, which is typically a requirement for the publication of research papers.
It aims to establish a central repository for next-generation sequencing data, linking to resources that reference or utilize this data. The repository allows in tracking project metadata for studies and experiments. There's a focus on facilitating flexible submission and retrieval of ancillary data, providing  normalized data structures. Additionally, the objectives include decoupling the submission process from content and laying the groundwork for interactive user submissions and data retrieval.

## SRA concepts:

SRA metadata concept separates experimental data from its metadata, organizing the latter into a structured hierarchy:

- **Study**: Represents a collection of experiments aimed at achieving a common goal, serving as an overarching project that encapsulates the purpose and scope of the research conducted. A study provides the context and rationale for the experiments.

- **Experiment**: Refers to a specific set of laboratory procedures applied to input material, designed to achieve an anticipated result. Each experiment is a component of a study, contributing to its overall objective. It can also be interpreted as a series of experimental protocols or assays conducted to test a hypothesis or gather data.

- **Sample**: The focus of an experiment, which can be a single sample or multiple samples grouped together. The results of an experiment are articulated based on these samples, detailing the outcomes for individual samples or their collective group as defined by the experimental setup. A sample is not equivalent to an individual, as one individual can provide multiple samples (e.g., right and left ventricle tissue samples).

- **Run**: Denotes the actual outcomes or results of the experiment. These runs encompass the data collected from a sample or a group of samples linked to a specific experiment. Essentially, a run is the execution of the sequencing or analytical process that generates data.

- **Submission**: A submission encompasses a bundle of metadata and data objects, coupled with instructions on how the submission should be handled. This package facilitates the organized and controlled entry of both experimental data and its corresponding metadata into the repository, ensuring that the data can be accurately classified, accessed, and utilized.

## Accessing the SRA

The SRA database can be accessed through the [NCBI website](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra).

Although discussing data access is outside the scope of this material, it is important to note that data access is a key aspect of the FAIR principles. This means that with the right metadata, data can be reused, generating more follow-up studies and citations.

Significant to note that not all data on the SRA is public, some data is private and only accessible to authorized users. Data can also be embargoed for a certain period of time. Recently, SRA started to use placeholder as a way to keep track of data produced by large cohort and require controlled access.

## Data deposition

There are multiple ways to deposit data on the SRA, the most common is through the submission portal. This approach is detailed [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/docs/submitportal/). At the CRC, we plan to streamline this process using a programmatic approach for data submission, as detailed in this [SOP](https://cloud.crc1550.com/index.php/s/NYkwKpMbHP3GTBn). We plan to automatize this process in the future.


## Metadata for a transcriptomics experiment

As you can realize, there are differences between the ISA framework and SRA. To enable the unambiguous interpretation and adhere to the FAIR framework, we take some pragmatic rules to define and create the Investigation, Study, and Assay files. The following table shows the required and recommended fields for an RNA-sequencing experiment, and can be easily adapted to other types of experiments.

- Comprehensive Repository: The SRA serves as a comprehensive public repository for high-throughput sequencing data across all life forms, supporting a wide range of genomic research by providing access to raw sequencing data and alignments.

- Structured Metadata Organization: The organization of SRA metadata into a structured hierarchyâ€”comprising Studies, Experiments, Samples, Runs, and Submissionsâ€”facilitates precise and efficient data deposition, retrieval, and analysis, underscoring the importance of detailed metadata in the scientific research process.

- Access and Deposition Flexibility: While access to the SRA database is facilitated through the NCBI website, the database also highlights the principles of controlled access and privacy for certain data sets, alongside offering multiple pathways for data deposition to accommodate the needs of diverse research projects and goals.
