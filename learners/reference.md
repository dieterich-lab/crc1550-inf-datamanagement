## Glossary

1. **Metadata**: Information that provides details about other data, such as the description and context of data files.
2. **OMICs**: Broad disciplines in biological sciences ending with -OMICs, like genomics or proteomics, studying various aspects of biology at system level.
3. **Genomics**: The study of genomes, the complete set of DNA within an organism, focusing on genetic variations and their functions.
4. **Transcriptomics**: Analysis of transcriptomes, the entire set of RNA transcripts produced by the genome, to understand gene expression.
5. **Proteomics**: The large-scale study of proteomes, the entire complement of proteins produced by an organism or system.
6. **Metabolomics**: The study of chemical processes involving metabolites, the small molecule intermediates and products of metabolism.
7. **FAIR Principles**: Guidelines for scientific data management and stewardship focusing on making data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.
8. **FASTQ Format**: A text-based format for storing both nucleotide sequences and their corresponding quality scores, widely used in high-throughput sequencing.
9. **Quality Scores**: Quantitative estimates of the reliability of each nucleotide in sequencing reads, encoded as ASCII characters in FASTQ files.
10. **Digital Object Identifier (DOI)**: A unique alphanumeric string assigned to a digital object, such as a dataset or publication, to provide a persistent link to its location on the internet.
11. **Sequence Read Archive (SRA)**: A public repository for high-throughput sequencing data, allowing researchers to share and access raw sequencing data.
12. **European Nucleotide Archive (ENA)**: A comprehensive public database of nucleotide sequences, including raw sequencing data, assembled genomes, and functional annotations.
13. **Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)**: A public repository for gene expression data, including microarray and high-throughput sequencing data, supporting data sharing and reuse.
14. **PRIDE archive**: A public repository for proteomics data, enabling researchers to share and access mass spectrometry data and related metadata.
